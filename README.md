# Full-Wave Voltage Doubler Circuit

Implemented a diode-capacitor based full-wave voltage doubler achieving approximately 2× peak input voltage.

## Objective

To design a voltage multiplier circuit without using a transformer.

## Components Used

- 1N4007 Diodes
- Capacitors
- AC Source
- CRO

## Working Principle

Capacitors charge on alternate half cycles of AC input, effectively stacking voltages to produce nearly double the peak input voltage.

## Testing

- Verified output waveform using CRO
- Measured voltage levels at output
- Analyzed capacitor charging behavior
